# Extraction of neural network topology from multi-electrode recordings
We investigated a neural network topology derived from neuronal spike data. We defined a criterion for the correlation of the activity pattern of two neurons, which allowed us to obtain a connectivity matrix and the corresponding (undirected) graph. We then examined the effect of bond percolation on the resulting network and conducted a comparative experimental test.
